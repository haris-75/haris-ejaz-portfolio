In-app purchases (IAP) in React Native require using native code for both iOS and Android because React Native doesn’t have a built-in module for IAP.

## Types of In-App Purchases (IAP)

Users can make different types of purchases within a mobile app. While the terms and specific types may vary slightly between iOS and Android, the following types are generally common:

### 1. Consumable Purchases

Consumable purchases are items that users buy and use up. These include things like virtual currency, extra lives, power-ups, or other virtual goods that can be consumed within the app.

**Example**: Purchasing virtual coins or gems in a game.

### 2. Non-Consumable Purchases

Non-consumable purchases are items that users buy once and have permanent access to. These include features or content that don’t get used up.

Accessing a premium feature, eliminating ads, or acquiring additional content like an extra level or chapter in a book app.

### 3. Auto-Renewable Subscriptions

Auto-renewable subscriptions allow users to access content or features on an ongoing basis. These subscriptions automatically renew at the end of the subscription period unless the user cancels.

**Example**: Monthly or annual subscription for premium content, access to exclusive features, or an ad-free experience.

Adding consumable purchases to an In-App Purchase (IAP) system involves several steps, and the specifics can vary depending on the platform (iOS, Android) and the tools/libraries you are using. Here are the general steps to implement consumable purchases in a React Native app using (for IOS) the `react-native-iap` library:

## 1. Install the library

First, you need to install the library. You can use npm, yarn, or any other node package manager you prefer:

```javascript
yarn add react-native-iap
```

OR

```javascript
npm install react-native-iap
```

## 1. Set up In App Purchase Products:

I assume you already have an **Apple Developer** account and an **app** created within that account. If you need help setting up an **Apple Developer** account and creating an **app**, you can refer to [this guide](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/add-a-new-app/).

Now, click on your app and follow these steps to create an in-app purchase product:

First, scroll to the bottom of the sidebar on your app page and click on **In-App Purchases** under the **Monetization** tab:

Next, click the plus icon next to the In-App Purchase Title:

![img-2](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sleafxtcb39x403aptw0.png)

A popup will appear like this::

![img-3](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yd3455z9t0cjymkwvf1x.png)

Select the type consumable and fill in the required information as shown:

![img-4](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mdo5zz7g33qe0lfhl8m5.png)

Click the save button, and you will be navigated to a screen where you can add more details for this in-app purchase product.

Then, select the availability of this in-app purchase product for different countries:

Next, choose the pricing by clicking the button shown below:
![img-6](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jldpdch6kyihuqz1w7ot.png)

A popup will appear where you can set the pricing according to your needs:
![img-7](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/br0dqdconrhqdtke9kyl.png)

Then, add localization for the in-app purchase product:
![img-8](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nnd0p83e3otctkukoko5.png)

A popup will appear like this:
![img-9](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jt4mvalg86iif4ewyq8y.png)

Next, you need to add an image of the app screen where this purchase will occur:

![img-10](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2xz3gawnvxvd3l0vf7xd.png)

And add review notes and you’re good to go.

That's it for the **App Store Connect** configuration. You will see this in-app purchase as a draft like below:

## 2. Configure Xcode For In App Purchase:

- Open your project workspace in Xcode.
- Select your project and click **Signing and Capabilities** tab:

![img-12](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b8t2268thiasi30gtuh8.png)

- Search for **In-App Purchase** and click on it:

That's it now let's move to the next step.

## 2. Integrate In App Purchase

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useIAP, requestPurchase, isIosStorekit2, PurchaseError } from 'react-native-iap';

export default function InAppComponent() {
const {
        products,
        currentPurchase,
        finishTransaction,
        getProducts,
        requestPurchase
    } = useIAP();
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

const productSkus = Platform.select({
  ios: ['10_COINS','20_COINS','30_COINS' ],
  android: [],
  default: [],
}) as string[];

useEffect(() => {
    handleGetProducts();
  }, []);

const handleGetProducts = async () => {
    try {
      setLoading(true)
      await getProducts({ skus: productSkus });
    } catch (error) {
      setLoading(false)
      console.log({ message: 'handleGetProducts', error });
    }
  };

 const handleBuyProduct = async (sku: Sku) => {
        try {
            setLoading(true);
            await requestPurchase({ sku });
        } catch (error) {
            handleError(error, 'handleBuyProduct');
        } finally {
            setLoading(false);
        }
    };

const handleError = (error: any, context: string) => {
        console.log(
            'Exception while making Request',
            error,
        );
    };

 useEffect(() => {
     const checkCurrentPurchase = async () => {
            try {
                if (
                    (isIosStorekit2() && currentPurchase?.transactionId) ||
                    currentPurchase?.transactionReceipt
                ) {
                    await finishTransaction({
                        purchase: currentPurchase,
                        isConsumable: true,
                    });
                    onApiCall(currentPurchase);
                }
            } catch (error) {
                handleError(error, 'checkCurrentPurchase');
            }
        };

        checkCurrentPurchase();
    }, [currentPurchase, finishTransaction]);

  const onApiCall = (params: any) => {
       console.log(params,"Call your API Here")
        setLoading(false);
    };

  return (
   <>
{products.map((product, index) => (
                <TouchableOpacity
                    onPress={() => handleBuyProduct(product.productId)}
                    key={index}
                >
                    <Text>
                        {product?.title} for{' '}
                        <Text>
                            {product?.localizedPrice}
                        </Text>
                    </Text>
                </TouchableOpacity>
            ))}
</>
  );
}
```

Sure, let's walk through the provided React Native code step by step:

1. **Import Statements**:
   Import the required modules and functions from the `react-native-iap` library.

2. **Product SKUs Definition**:
   Define the product SKUs according to the platform, in this case, iOS.

> _SKU is the ID of the in app product that you've created at the first step_.

3. **handleGetProducts Function**:
   On the initial page render, retrieve all products linked to your Apple Store account. Use these products to establish a connection with the In-App Purchase (IAP) system. Map the retrieved products to display them in your view.

4. **handleBuyProduct Function**:
   After listing the products, use the `handleBuyProduct` function to start the purchase process. Pass your unique `productId` as an argument. Once executed, the `handleBuyProduct` function will return a response in the `currentPurchase` variable. This response can then be sent to your API for storage.

> _To test this IAP integration in the development environment, follow these steps_:

> - _Run the app on a real device in debug mode_.
> - _Use the Apple account that you've set up as a sandbox account_.
